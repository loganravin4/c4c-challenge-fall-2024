Welcome to Logan Ravinuthala's Code4Community submission! Here, you will find a screen that consists of our very first partner and the option to remove that partner from C4C. You may also add a new partner with a name, description, thumbnailUrl, and active status. To add a new partner, I decided to make a dropdown menu since it would be very out of the way and only accessible when necessary. The partners will be displayed side by side in a grid format. To get started, make sure you complete the following:

## Prerequisites

If you don't have them already, you'll need to install Node.js/NPM and Git:
- Node.js + NPM - install [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) (we highly recommend using at least Node 18.0.0 + NPM 8.6.0)
   - You can choose to install via the command line under "Package Manager", or download an installer under "Prebuilt Installer"
   - Node and NPM are installed together
- Git - install [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo on to your computer. You can do so with the [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/), or in a terminal with the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/loganravin4/c4c-challenge-fall-2024.git
```
2. In a terminal, run `npm install` **at the root of this project** to install the required packages
3. Run `npm run dev` **at the root of this project** to start the app locally
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the website
    
    4a. The backend will be available at `http://localhost:4000`


By tackling this project, I learned a lot more about Javascript and its frontend development component. I've also never touched a backend file prior to this other than linking API key routes. I didn't do much this time around either, however if I had more time, I would definitely read up on a Javascript backend and how to work through it. I've only ever used Flask and Python for backend development. I was constantly running into random design issues where the dropdown menus and buttons wouldn't overlay properly. My fix for this was relative positioning in the CSS file for the most part, otherwise increasing grid sizes. I hope you enjoy playing around with my project!
